          <p id="article-content">While not normally known for his artistic talent, Tesla and SpaceX Billionaire CEO Elon Musk is releasing a debut album on Friday the 13th studio album from the enigmatic Tesla and entrepreneur-turned-billionaire is being released by former R&B singer Paula Patton. His follow-up to his successful 2011 release from Genius/Mad Decent, the album features some of the rarest and most famous vocals in both Tesla's and Musk's oeuvre.The album is being released alongside the release of the Tesla Model 3. Musk previously explained the inspiration behind the new electric vehicle , arguing that getting to the market of affordable electric vehicles is an urgent need.While the Tesla Model 3 and 930 have proved a successful entry point into the electric vehicle market for several mainstream automakers, such as General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi and BMW, the company will have to replicate this success with its first mass-market electric vehicle. While cheaper Model 3 will cater to the niche buyer who needs a more affordable electric car, the 930 is targeted at the large-scale EV, would-be buyer looking to complete their vehicle set.According to those who have been in the know for a while now, the reason why Tesla didn't launch the Model 3 before has everything to do with the production volume of Model S and Model X, which Tesla has in large enough quantities to meet the demand in the same number of units. The Model 3 will have to be even more disruptive, but it is clear that the company doesn't want to let the competition outpace it with lighter, cheaper, and more durable electric cars. Even with its promise of long range, the Model 3 will be much smaller than Tesla's current vehicles, which means the Model 3 will be hard to manufacture—which means low production yields. A large production run of the new car would require the entire engineering department to revolve around one prototype, even if this one prototype becomes the cheapest Model 3 in history.

The short notice of the start of production also means that the automaker's production has to adhere to unrealistic deadlines.
As a result, the 2016 model year cars will get a substantial power upgrade — the powertrain will get a turbocharged engine and a more efficient powertrain body, and a new transmission.

Previously, the series production version of the platform got an all-new transmission in 2014.

So when you can see the 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata on dealer lots, you might notice the last transmission you see on that version might be the same as on the last generation of the MX-5 Miata.
We know this because this engine is the same one that was in the 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata that was introduced at the 2014 Detroit Auto Show. While it is a fine execution of a naturally aspirated V6 with an 8-speed automatic transmission, it is also due to a bad design decision.

This transmission is called a 3.6L V6. It is the same engine that was on the Mazda MX-5 Miata and it's also found in all generations of the popular Mazda 3.
There are two options available to the owner of a Mazda Miata.

The first is an automatic transmission for those who just want the benefits of automatic. The transmission puts out 102 horsepower and has an advertised 0-60 time of 6.5 seconds. While this may sound like a lot, don't think too much about the figure. It's significantly lower than a turbocharged engine like an engine such as a turbocharged 4 cylinder and it's just as fast as the 5.0L V8 found in the Mazda MX-5 Miata

Until next year, you'll have to hunt for some gearshifts in the form of blue-d
