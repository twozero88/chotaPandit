          <p id="article-content">Since most of you have already seen the discussion happening on our forums, I will only mention a few of the more interesting points so far. Let's start with this simple question: who can do blogging better? Both sides of the argument agree that WordPress is a more capable, user-friendly and flexible blogging platform. However, the two developers disagree on a few key points, including configuration, file hosting and the blog feed architecture.

WordPress' FAQ page describes a few frequently asked questions. Here's a brief summary, but see the full list for a detailed answer.

To make it easier to read, I've combined them into the graphic below, which shows a wider selection of all the tools on both the sites.
According to the new Developers Network rules, any website can now publish using WordPress and it is up to the site owner to decide the minimum required requirements. This approach enables a lot more freedom, but also leaves some issues unresolved.

Local SEO

The potential of WordPress as an SEO tool has a whole team of  people focused on building it to its full potential. They develop a clear recommendation and recommendations for best practices and various blogging plugins. This, in addition to site ranking optimisation, is a major part of the WordPress built-in SEO capabilities. In this article we'll take a look at the differences between the main SEO tools.

Rankings + Domain Authority

These days, a Google Search engine considers an individual page only when it has questions about a particular word or term. That's why the results page

a lot of times looks like this:


3. Criteria For A Lot Of The Search Results
To make sure that the good, trustworthy results you want, you need to check the
right criteria. That's why it's better to use a search engine with comprehensive
search filters. Here are some of them:
1. Can a user submit items for the search engine? (Yes, but this can be useful for
a few cases. Like if your search term is "pizza").
2. Is the site functioning as a "Mobile responsive Site"
2. Can a user submit popular lists or advertisement for a business?
Yes. However, it should not be done maliciously or spammy and should only be the user's idea to submit items that interest the user, such as their interests and life goals. "You are now looking for something (ex) ..." is not allowed as it will result in these items getting ranked higher. However, "I want you to do what I am looking for in ..." is permitted. If you are not on the list of 'keyword advertisers', this is your option. If you want a low rated item in a certain category, then you may feel free to submit it.

New vHosts:

Twice-enabled (formerly Nginx Switched to Twice) :

- Rollup webserver configuration

- The same as above, but hosts do not take that slow command line

- The new UPLOADS() command does NOT upload to the upstream and vhost URL. It only uploads to the regular page, so your users do not see the zipped file on their site!

- All systems will now use vhost.com

- Long enough after directory creation to make a cacheable .htaccess file (and not just a local one)

- Automatic vhost rewrite after directory is first created
