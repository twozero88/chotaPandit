          <p id="article-content">The wait for National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, NEET 2020 Examination is over. HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal in his live webinar has announced that NEET 2020 exam would be conducted on July 26, 2020 and the results would be out in August-September 2020.


The entire test is given online and it is not similar to the old English and mathematical test from UPSC which used to be conducted on paper. NEET 2016 was conducted over four days for almost 6,000 students at 54 different centres. Results were released two weeks later.


Students would have to give 50-50 score in two parts of NEET for passing out of the examination.
The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) 2016 will be conducted in an online format from 1st April 2016 from 12:00pm. The entire test is given online and it is not similar to the old English and mathematical test from UPSC which used to be conducted on paper. NEET 2016 was conducted over four days for almost all the NEET candidates but the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has removed the three-day exams conducted in October 2014 and the WORT 2015 which was conducted in 2011-12.

With NEET 2016, the stakes are higher.

"The test is more difficult than ever, especially for more rigorous class X," says HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar who  was speaking at the launch of the awareness programme.In the last five years, more than 36.50 lakh children have joined the Class X level examinations. "The objective of the program is not to pass exams but to ensure that they learn on how to study," Javadekar added.On Sunday, more than 100 leading companies, including Reliance Industries, Birla Sun Life, Dabur and Infosys participated in the test preparation drive. A few universities, private institutes, civic groups and technology firms also participated in the drive.Talking about the safety measures being taken to ensure that the procedure does not cause injury, he said,.
