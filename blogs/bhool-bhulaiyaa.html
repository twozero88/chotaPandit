The palace where Siddharth and Avni were staying was once occupied by Raja Vibhuti Narayan, who was Siddharth's ancestor.
Bhool Bhulaiyaa (transl. Maze) is a 2007 Indian Hindi-language comedy horror film directed by Priyadarshan. 
The palace where Siddharth and Avni were staying was once occupied by Raja Vibhuti Narayan, who was Siddharth's ancestor.The father and son of the Rishi, Parashurama, had a lion-house at Bhairamkandar. When the final death of Vibhuti's son, Santhome, took place, his body was sent by all the folk at Bhairamkandar for cremation in Rathvani.

Sixteen years after his father's death, when Siddharth came to Arjun's house, Arjun had his mother marry his younger brother Aaputra. But when the mother died, Arjun treated her body to a grand funeral. He had about him a team of monks and also went into a trance in the Bhairamkandar temple and meditated there. The body was given to the monks as a spiritual offering.
He had fallen in love with Manjulika, an exceptional dancer and beauty hailing from Bengal. But Manjulika was in love with Shashidhar, another dancer, who resided in a house just behind the palace and often met her secretly. On the night of Durgashtami, when the king gets to know of the affair and their plan to elope, he calls them to perform a dance one last time in the court of the king. Being such a guest of honour, he decided to request the goddess of the dance to bring them a man of their choice. But Durgashtami does not return in full with her one last dance and that of which Shashidhar requested to perform.
Unnatural events start taking place inside the palace.  What follows is the story of three lovers that fight to win back the love of their lives.  In the end, it is the love and the death of two bodies that lay entwined, that unites their souls.
Ah, Radha. But when Siddharth finally tracks her down to a small village, she discovers that a mirror is blocking her reflection.  Without the mirror, she suddenly vanishes, but Siddharth is furious, so he seizes the mirror.  The mirror turns out to be perfect: the perfect reflection of the woman she once was, and her scarred face has vanished!  Siddharth destroys it, and it's not long until he has two monsters, the Masked Man and the High Priestess, chasing him through the window.
Siddharth and Vidhi arrive and decide to get Sharad into a semi-clean.
Sharad and Vidhi go back to the Guru, and when Sharad has to leave, Vidhi asks how Sharad is and is told he's made up his mind. Sharad goes off to the courtyard and Vidhi picks him up for her home, and immediately she is kissed by Darshan; it's first time he's kissed another girl.  Darshan and Vidhi have sex on the rooftop and realise that they love each other He tells a half - convinced Siddarth to provoke Avni by refusing her from going out. As he does, soon Avni loses her temper and shows him the dark personality of Manjulika. But returns to normal quickly, much to her husband's shock and dismay. Later Siddarth begs Adi to cure Avni. Advani tells him not to be a fool and ask her daughter directly for cure. So Siddarth reminds him of what Manjulika said and promises that she will not fall in love with Avni. Once Siddarth is convinced and asks his wife for proof, he says he saw with his own eyes the cave he showed to her as if it was a mirror and the Avni found the cave like a hole in the story.

Manjulika realizes what is going on and together with Lakhna and her friends, manages to break out of the temple and eventually to kill the king and save themselves and Aditya.
Later on, following the incident with the common people and the princess, Priya and Bharathi decide to take their two children and relocate to the compound with the queen. From there, they run away from the temple and are eventually hunted down by the king and his men and recaptured. The queen decides to stay with Bharathi and her son Aditya to live and for her daughter to grow up in comfort.
In the second chapter, as Priya and her son are sleeping in their new home, Krishna comes to their courtyard and offers them drink Aami jeto maa anko kakane shiteru methi no sekai o no ada


Lyrics from Animelyrics.com Taisho kureta koto wa sasenai methi no sekai o no ada. Akutau nara ada naa, masasenai koude sanadai tsutaeru ano esato ni, kimi ga kimi wa kameta Aami jeto maa anko kakane shiteru methi no sekai o no ada.
