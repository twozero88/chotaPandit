          <p id="article-content">Waititi has always been an ardent "Star Wars" fan. In 2014, he announced his intention to develop a Star Wars movie with director Gareth Edwards. However, he didn't become attached until 2015, when the studio hired him to direct the film.

With Star Wars: The Force Awakens opening next year, the film — once again helmed by Edwards — is definitely the most critical thing coming down the pike. J.J. Abrams is directing
and the last time this happened, Episode IV: A New Hope was widely regarded as the best movie in the series.

I recently sat down with J.J. Abrams for a very long chat about Star Wars, making the film, and going back to direct the next Star Wars movie. I found this particularly fascinating because Abrams started out writing the first Star Wars movie, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan, but quit before wrapping the script. He felt that the movie he would be directing was "too different" from the first, and even though he hadn't become an Academy Award winner for his work in the first Star Trek movie, he felt that this was "more interesting" than another genre film.

Exclusive First Look at

STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS UK

Tako Hiraoka's stunning work as General Hux has been announced as the cover image for the upcoming Canadian print release of THE FORCE AWAKENS.  The whole thing is below. But first, we have some other goodies for you.

We just wrapped our episode with 7 Upgrades for the Galaxy – as in, improvements to the devices, images, and audio in the video. Our daily challenge is always to get our viewers to ask us about them, so we tried this week. We tried to reach into all kinds of pockets of geekdom to find the perfect item – on Thursday night, it was a week of theme songs, another week we did easter eggs. Today's thing is taking a few odds and ends and augmenting hem with some modern technology. Get the system and the particular sound file to do what you want in the game:
On Thursday night at the taping of

CBS's The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Obama unveiled his latest data-driven

plan for beefing up government security. But as it turned out, it was the GOP

that felt threatened by Obama's surge in new vetting procedures. Colbert had

what was shaping up to be the anti-Obama response: not only did he start his

episode by teasing, "Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Chinese," he then went on to

view the president's counterterrorism strategy with what he called a "concerned

appreciation," then some.

Check out the clip here (starting about the 2:30 mark).
