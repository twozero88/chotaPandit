          <p id="article-content">We are trying our best to ensure that no one in the country loses life due to shortage of drinking water, says Gujarat Governor Gujarat's drinking water availability, as per the year 2011-12, is 120 million litres. The 11 years to 2015-16 witnessed a 24 per cent increase in availability of drinking water in the state. According to data compiled by the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS) at Thane, as per availability data for the year 2011-12, the total availability of drinking water was 120 million litres. In 2015-16, the availability is estimated to be around 270 million litres. According to Gujarat government officials, the reasons for the jump n availability of drinking water are increased rainfall, desilting work done on rivers and canals as well as the construction of reservoirs in high plains. The drought situation has now become normal, according to Gujarat agriculture department officials, who said that the new trend indicates that rainfall will improve further.

However, the reason for the increase in the demand is the weather pattern of coming rains. According to Chief Technical Advisor and Chief Scientist of the state's meteorological department P M Karthik, since last few days the annual average rainfall in the western half of the state has increased with strong thunderstorms making their appearance from November 24, 2014 onwards, bringing heavy downpour and flood into the adjoining states.

Despite the heavier rains the growing irrigation water requirements have become a cause of worry for the neighbouring states. "The state is spending an average 
Despite the heavier rains the growing irrigation water requirements have become a cause of worry for the neighbouring states. "The state is spending an average of Rs 15 crore per km of irrigation water per day," said Mohan Kumar, a chief engineer with the Southern Punjab Waigal Authority (SPAWA) who has been overseeing water scarcity in the area for the past two decades. "Most of the aquifers are already full."

Rainfall varies from region to region as well as year to year. In the Rajasthan state, for example, the last five years have seen an average of 3,000 mm of rainfall a year while in Uttar Pradesh, some states have seen as little as 300 mm.

In mid-January, an 11-year-old child in UP's Aligarh district was reportedly killed by the brunt of the monsoon due to poor storage of water in the area. At least 80 other children have been reported to have died so far.

"The massive rainfall is wreaking havoc in the entire country in the aftermath of the failed monsoon and this failure has put everybody through a false sense of security," national convenor of All India Kisan Sabha (AIKSA) Abhishek Manu Singhvi said. "The farmers are not getting proper crops. The health of the people is at stake. Our role in the upcoming elections in 2016 has to be shown by throwing open the doors of the Constitution to some of the serious issues of farmers like farmer suicides and indebtedness of farmers. If the Supreme Court knows our situation, why are they going with the misleading process of PAN and Aadhaar so far? The blame lies with the Election Commission and the State governments."

Singhvi said if the courts pass the order against Aadhaar for the Election Commission in the next few days, it would invite questions. "You can use Aadhaar by a thief but you cannot use it to hold a government"
