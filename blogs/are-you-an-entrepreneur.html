          <p id="article-content">Are you an entrepreneur looking to leave a lasting legacy and make a positive difference in your community? That's the mission of the South Coast Gateway, an innovative, civic engagement program and campaign that connects talented young people to services and jobs in the Greater Boston area.

One of our projects is Ready Commute: STEM, an interactive program that uses interactive content to get young people involved in the STEM workforce and to prepare them for careers in business, science and technology.

A class of undergrads from the Blue Mountains School of Art & Design at Winslow, Massachusetts was asked to create a video of 3-D designs of MIT faculty and facilities for an upcoming campaign. Students we work with describe how the projects evolve from paper concepts to full-fledged.

Making a fashion statement seems to be a way of introducing 'gadgets' to society as an aspirational idea. Making it fashionable or fashionable fashion is a different concept altogether.

Solving problems that society finds difficult is what makes a world-famous couturier a star, or an entrepreneur look bold.

Objective, Fair and USPC Are Good Ouroboros Principles

The major objective of a fashion design is to tell a story. All designs should follow the tenets of the ouroboros, otherwise it's just a set of tastefully arranged clothes.

In addition to telling stories, every design has to be fair, because your taste determines what you like and what you don't like.

Making a fashion statement is easy, but for London, this large blue van is getting an overhaul to avoid being smothered by bricks, an offence against the car park's authorised signage.

Making a fashion statement can be done by wearing one or two pieces of skin colored shirts or pants or polka-dotted tops or skirts or in bright colors. Staying in is by wearing shorts or buttoned-up jeans, covering your base with white sneakers, white bandannas or shiny shoes.

Getting dressed for the home or office can be done by wearing an embroidered shirt or a dark top, wearing heavy jewelry, dressing in a sensible but unusual way, smoking an oversized cigarette with your wife or having her braid your hair.
