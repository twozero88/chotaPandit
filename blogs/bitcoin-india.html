          <p id="article-content">10 Nov — India's e-commerce regulator has lifted the ban on the trading of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin on Delhi-based e-commerce platform Snapdeal and global logistics company OYO Rooms.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it issued the new licence to regulate the trading of these cryptocurrencies on a voluntary basis.

Under the licence, trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be permitted only from 1 November. While trading of traditional currencies will remain prohibited.

Some states such as Maharashtra and Punjab had banned the trade of cryptocurrencies.

"A product registration form will be made available for viewing. In case of violation, the final decision will be taken by the regulator. In case of non-compliance, action will be taken," the DIPP said.

The decision comes after the new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been examining the issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and asked authorities to keep a watch on them. It has asked all central banks to examine cryptocurrency as well as traditional financial instruments to know if there is any "less-risky and more reliable method of transactions.
Earlier this week, RBI had cautioned people against starting a digital currency exchange business.

Last year, the Reserve Bank had prohibited the operators of virtual currency exchanges and offline platforms from conducting transactions worth Rs 500 and above.

There was, however, some ambiguity in RBI's official publication in 2015, which exempted certain persons and entities from the above ban and said that the banks have been asked to contact them in case of any violation.

Initially, the RBI permitted high net worth individuals (HNWIs) to purchase and trade digital currencies and their transactions were permitted, but were also allowed to be conducted only at banks, fintech companies and trading platforms, with certain conditions.

Earlier this month, after a meeting of the department of economic affairs, which comprises the RBI and the finance ministry, a revised circular was issued stating that RBI will allow banking partners to hold and trade digital currencies like bitcoin.

The new circular states that a bank partnership, an association for the purpose of exploring new payment and settlement technologies with a banking partner, may participate in such an activity by permitting the partner to conduct at least one RBI-approved transaction in the bank's currency, under the terms and conditions that the bank determines are reasonable, including terms and conditions for customer registration and KYC requirements.

The RBI said that the participant has a duty to maintain appropriate AML controls and compliance policies and procedures in its network and its clearing and settlement systems to ensure the integrity of transactions, and to monitor transactions to detect, prevent and mitigate the misuse of its network by users.
The absence of a single centralized record of trading and transfers meant that discrepancies in the alleged misappropriated money were not spotted by the regulators until it was too late.

"This, coupled with the lack of contact with the aggrieved party is why we took the course of action we did. We are disappointed to see a lack of concern for those in our system and the lack of co-operation from the mangers and other officers of the company," a senior official said.
