          <p id="article-content">The feature spread last week on The Information's site, with a follow-up story Thursday. Currently, Apple has six new smartwatches. On October 27th, it will introduce five more. And according to The Information, October 28th is the day the Apple Watch will go on sale. Whether this rumor is correct or not, the release date is certainly looking more plausible every manner.
The series that follows the Apple Watch, and it will ship in October 2020 This series will feature an understated stainless steel finish with gold accents. We will first be looking at a sports watch in the Milanese Loop design and will see two strap options, a traditional strap or a newer, slightly more premium look.

The design is reminiscent of the Basis Peak released by ETA in 2018, though this is very different. The Milanese Loop features a separate ring at the bottom of the bracelet to replace the standard strap that the Apple Watch comes with. There is also a rotatable crown on the side of the band to adjust the time and date, although you can use a flat screw to do so. The Milanese Loop is a great-option for those wanting a sporty look, particularly those who might have traditional wrist watch requirements.

Considered Legitimate Wearable Watches

Other sporty accessories from Timex include the Rope Loop, Tank Loop, and LadyP Band, as well as the Junior Fit. It is possible to buy original.
Timex watches and continue to wear them beyond the original three year warranty.

As with most fashion brands, you are more likely to find used Timex watches at auctions or on eBay, than new watches. A watch made between 1945 and 1977 was probably under warranty, and most vintage watches are to fair to excellent condition. While an original will still last many years, it is usually not as good as a well cared for example. They will be a little more brittle, and as such, require more care and attention. Although many can be repaired or returned to original condition, there are some problems that require a complete repair or replacement of the movement. New factory bought ones can be had and work quite well for an inexpensive, easy-to-own investment, if you know how to keep a watch safe. 
So this is what we can expect from apple's big launch event. This event is intended to announce an initiative that basically took place on Monday morning. If you've read some of our posts on the new Watch and the HomePod then you know that the company has been pushing some watch-style apps into the watchOS app store.

What we haven't seen is any information on when those apps will come to the iPhone; specifically the iOS platform. I'm hoping that an announcement might come tomorrow, before Apple opens its October 27 keynote.

One of the main questions I've been hoping to get answered is exactly how much data is sent between your phone and the Apple Watch. We're hoping that the answer is something like "less than 5 MB".
